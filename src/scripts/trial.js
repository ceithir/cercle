<p>Nothing else needs to be said. One by one, the adults who've witnessed the ceremony leave the island and return to the village. Soon, only Raiahui is left, feeling strangely exhausted and contemplative now that the trial is over. Almost dreamily, she touches her lips with the tips of her fingers.

<p>Your head finally emerges above the water. You increase your speed slightly, but it's much too early to really force the pace. Focused on your steady swimming strokes, you nearly forget about the race for a while, feeling nothing but the unmitigated pleasure swimming always brings you.</p>

<p>You're nearly halfway when many loud exclamations reach your ears. Glancing back without slowing down, you see that all the adolescents have gathered close to the shore. Judging from the excited way they wave their arms, Raiahui has only just dived into the water.</p>

<p>You don't increase your pace immediately. After all, your head start is considerable. Out of caution, you cast a few glances behind you afterward, but they strangely fail to reveal anything: at no point do you spot Raiahui's head above the surface and her position is a complete mystery.</p>

<p>How can she hold her breath for so long?</p>

<p>The adults of the tribe are gathered in a thick circle, and studying you with much closer attention than they did yesterday. You're too exhausted to really feel afraid anymore; anyway, their faces show no signs of hostility, merely deep curiosity.</p>

<div class="conversation">
<p>"You've deserved our respect, Mananuiva," Ataroa says with almost perceptible admiration. "It's not often that an outsider wins one of our races."</p>
</div>

<p>A few cutting remarks come to your mind, but even if you dared to speak them, you simply feel too tired to do so.</p>

<div class="conversation">
<p>"You're free to go," the chieftain adds, and he points at your outrigger canoe, waiting at the other end of the islet with a new mast and a sail quivering in the evening breeze. "We've taken care of your craft and filled it with the supplies you may need. As for your rewardâ€¦"</p>
</div>

<p>He gestures and another man approaches, bearing a bowl full of a greyish beverage.</p>

<div class="conversation">
<p>"The Foam of the Deep is yours. There's only one ingredient left to add, and we'll take care of that right now. It's normally provided by the one who'll drink the Foam, but given the circumstances, it's only fair that it comes from somebody else."</p>
</div>

<p>Two adults come forward, holding an obviously terrified Raiahui between them. Ataroa grabs her wrist and cuts her palm deeply with his knife. Blood trickles into the bowl, and the beverage immediately takes a bright silvery hue.</p>

<div class="conversation">
<p>"The Foam of the Deep is ready," says Ataroa, presenting it to you. "Drink it this evening, and you'll visit the world of spirits during your sleep."</p>
</div>

<p>He now turns toward your trembling opponent.</p>

<div class="conversation">
<p>"Raiahui," he says in a cold voice, "you don't deserve to become an adult. You've failed your trial out of arrogance, by underestimating your opponent. I'm sure you won't take your next test so lightly."</p>
</div>

<p>He grabs the young woman's knife and throws it far away into the lagoon.</p>

<div class="conversation">
<p>"If you manage to get back to the village, your foolishness will be forgiven."</p>
</div>

<p>The hands that were holding Raiahui suddenly release her. The young woman casts a frightened look at the adults surrounding her. Then she runs toward the shore and dives into the lagoon. You watch as she swims as fast as possible toward the spot where her knife has sunk. Trapped in her human shape, she remains a very good swimmer, but you're sure that you could have beaten her in a normal race.</p>

<p>Ataroa turns toward you and nods his farewell.</p>

<div class="conversation">
<p>"I hope you'll find what you seek, Mananuiva."</p>
</div>

<p>Then all of the adults head for the shore and dive in turn. In the clear water, you see their sleek shapes chasing after Raiahui.</p>

<p>You don't want to know what's going to happen in the lagoon; you're not even sure that you have a preference for one of the two possible outcomes. You cross the sandy island and sit in front of the ocean. The steady sound of the waves relaxes you, easing the tension from your muscles. It won't be long before the sun reaches the horizon behind you.</p>

<p>You look at the Foam of the Deep, its shining surface vaguely reflecting your face. Is this worth all your efforts and the dangers you've faced? It doesn't matter now: your adventure on this atoll already belongs to the past, and your quest is far from over.</p>

<p>You settle comfortably and bring the bowl to your lips.</p>

A few vigorous breaststrokes under the surface propel you toward the sandy island. When you come back to the surface, a quick glance behind you reveals that Raiahui's still on the beach, surrounded by the other adolescents. She doesn't even seem to be looking in your direction.</p>

<p>You've covered a fourth of the distance when excited cries reach your ears, coming from the beach. You opponent must have finally started the race. You do little more than increase your pace slightly. Even if Raiahui really is a better swimmer than you are, your head start virtually ensures your victory, as long as you don't exhaust yourself too quickly.</p>

<p>And yet, irrational anxiety is creeping in your mind. From time to time, you cast glances behind you, but you're unable to spot Raiahui, as if she were swimming underwater without ever surfacing. Unable to put a name on your fear, you force the pace earlier than you'd intended, before you've even reached the halfway point.</p>

<p>The warm water of the channel close around both of you at the same time, but a few vigorous breaststrokes enable you to get ahead of Raiahui. You know that you'll need to save your strength during the first half of the race, but finding herself behind you right from the start should shake your opponent's self-confidence.</p>

<p>Your head finally emerges above the water and you're nearly deafened by the cries coming from the beach. Raiahui's still underwater, but you don't waste time trying to determine her exact position. Now that the race has started, force of habit makes you focus on nothing but your swimming strokes.</p>

<p>But your concentration only lasts until the next time you take a breath in. Something's wrong. Raiahui still hasn't resurfaced and the cries coming from the beach are reaching a peak of shrill excitement.</p>

<p>You quickly disappear among the palm trees, followed by the amused eyes of the adolescents. Once you're sure they can no longer see you, you throw away the calabash - still almost full - and run toward a part of the beach that's sufficiently far away. This alternative starting point will barely increase the distance you need to cross to reach the sandy islet that's your goal.</p>

<p>Hidden behind a tree, you cast a quick glance in the direction of the tribe's adolescents. One of them might spot you while you cross the beach, but their unruly merrymaking doesn't make it very likely. You hope that it'll also delay the moment when your opponent realizes that you've been absent for too long.</p>

<p>You don't imagine for a moment that she intends to win the race by simply reaching the islet before you do. However, it's possible that she doesn't quite know where you've hidden yourself.</p>

<p>You take a very brief moment to consider the situation.

To your left, not very far, another coral reef emerges from the sandy bottom; it doesn't have any recesses, but it's just large enough to hide you as long as you keep it between Raiahui and yourself. To your right, a larger reef seems to offer better hiding places, but it's much farther.</p>
