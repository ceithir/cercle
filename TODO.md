## Making things work

### Fix log system

Saving current section text on component*Mount()?

## Cool game

### Display informations learned during the introduction on "the map"

Like where is the old lazybones, the paria etc.

### Complete achievements

### Make optional choices look less sucky

### Display time passing by

Different text in "back-to-hub"?

### Display physical state

A red warning when drunk
A green text when in great form

## Polish

### Post-process script for French special characters

###  Simplify "next" declaration

Array => Crossroads
Object => Funnel

### Proper favicons and all icons for all devices

### Fluidify transitions

Transitions could be more fluid, more context-sensitive. Right now, it's painfully obvious the same block of text is printed as is in several places.
